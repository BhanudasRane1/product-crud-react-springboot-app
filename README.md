# product-crud-react-springboot-app
A full-stack Product Management CRUD application built with React for the frontend and Spring Boot (Spring Web + Spring Data JPA) for the backend. This project demonstrates RESTful API integration, component-based UI, and a clean separation of frontend and backend layers.
